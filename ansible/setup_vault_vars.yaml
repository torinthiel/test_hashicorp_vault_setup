# As we are dealing with Hashicorp Vault and Ansible Vault this presents
# a naming conflict. Accoridng to best practices, variables should be
# previxed with vault_ when adding to Ansible Vault, but because of the 
# conflict ansible_vault_ prefix will be used here.
#
# As this is just an example, the password to Ansuble Vault is 'password'.
